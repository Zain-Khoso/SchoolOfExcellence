# School Of Excellence

## Overview

I created this project when I was still fairly new to web development. It’s a recreation of my school’s website at the time. I challenged myself to avoid using libraries and relied purely on vanilla JavaScript.

Through this project, my understanding of JavaScript deepened significantly — I learned about the Intersection Observer API, built a custom slider component from scratch, and gained a lot of confidence as a developer.

This project required real effort and patience, and it helped me grow into a more capable and prepared developer.
